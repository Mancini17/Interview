<section> 
	<h3> MANCINI - Why do you want to be a designer? </h3>
<p>MS. ROSS - I want to be a graphic designer because I want to used my creative skills in my everyday life. I love
the idea of working with different kinds of clients and also think that being a graphic designer can
provide me with everyday problems and challenges that I will enjoy solving.</p>
</section>

<section>
	<h3> MANCINI - What makes you nervous about becoming a designer? </h3>
<p>MS. ROSS - What makes me nervous is that graphic design is a very broad term. There are a lot of different
fields and directions of which I can enter, and as of now I am not 100% positive where I will end up
in the field.</p>
</section>

<section>
	<h3>MANCINI - What excites you about design?</h3>
<p>MS. ROSS - What excited me about design is that it is limitless. It is continuously evolving. I also love that it can
communicate in so many different ways.</p>

<section>
	<h3>MANCINI - What are your strengths?</h3>
<p>MS. ROSS - I think my strengths are my analog work. I am a good illustrator.</p>
</section>

<section>
	<h3>MANCINI - What are some areas of opportunity to work on?</h3>
<p>MS. ROSS - Some areas that I need to work on are my technical skills in many of the adobe programs. Though I
have gotten much better, I still find that there are times when I have a good idea, but simply am
limited by my skills in these programs.</p>
</section>

<section>
	<h3>MANCINI - What aspects of graphic design do you gravitate towards?</h3>
<p>MS. ROSS - I gravitate towards illustration. I am also finding that I really like information graphics.</p>
</section>

<section>
	<h3>MANCINI - What are the roles and responsibilities of a graphic designer in society?</h3>
<p>MS. ROSS - In my opinion a graphic designer has a very large roll in society. Graphic Designers control almost
everything we see and therefore can influence the opinion and attitudes of our consumers. In my
opinion society as a whole can be shaped and formed through graphic designers.</p>
</section>

<section>
	<h3>MANCINI - When/where/why are you at your most creative/productive?</h3>
<p>MS. ROSS - I am at my most creative in the morning, after I have done a workout. I am most productive when I am out
of the house and at school or a coffee shop to do work. This is because I have the most energy in the
morning after I have worked out. My home for me is my place of rest, and I try not to do any work at home.
Instead I get out of the house and work elsewhere.</p>
</section>

<section>
	<h3>MANCINI - What are your comfort levels with giving and receiving feedback?</h3>
<p>MS. ROSS - I think that I could be better at giving feedback. Sometimes I worry about hurting peoples feelings and
saying too much. I love constructive criticism and think it is the only way you will ever get better at what
you are doing. I like to receive feedback.</p>
</section>

<section>
	<h3>MANCINI - What is a webiste?</h3>
<p>MS. ROSS - A website for me is a place on the internet where people can visually and physically interact and
receive information and give information.</p>
</section>

<section>
	<h3>MANCINI - Why did you choose to come into this program?</h3>
<p>MS. ROSS - I chose to come into this program because I was no longer as passionate about the field I previously
studied in. I know that I love to be creative and problem solve and this program was a perfect fit for
me and where I am at in my life.</p>
</section>

<section>
	<h3>MANCINI - Who do you look up to in Graphic Design (inspiration)?</h3>
<p>MS. ROSS - I would not say that I have one person in particular that I look up to. Rather I love to be inspired by
other peoples work. I often surf through work on Behance and other Internet platforms and become
inspired.</p>
</section>

<section>
	<h3>MANCINI - So far, which course has been your favourite?</h3>
<p>MS. ROSS - So Far my favourite course has been intro to technology with Chris during our first semester.</p>
</section>

<section>
	<h3>MANCINI - What are some things that you dislike doing within the program?</h3>
<p>MS. ROSS - Some things that I dislike doing in this program are procrastinating. It is really hard to catch up in
classes once you are behind, as the work can be very time consuming.</p>
